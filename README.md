# Genome Updater
This project is designed to help a scientist update genome files so they can run simulations on a modified set of genes. Take a look at `example.js` to see how to use this. There are some example files in `test_fixtures/`
It was written in a hurry, and then has been further modified to be in special need of refactoring.
