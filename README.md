# Genome Updater

## Getting set up

install nodejs
install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Guidelines:
There are some tests and they are all passing. 
Tests should be passing when you're done too, but
 A) you can change them e.g. if you want to change the interface to a function.
 B) it's more important to understand what interfaces you're creating and be able to describe how you've divided up the code
 
In fact, feel free to re-write from scratch in Python or something. Just keep in mind the [principles we talked about](

When we meet back we will talk through some of the refactors folks did.
Checkout a new branch and push your refactors there
eg. `git checkout -b your-name-refactor`

Hint: You should end up with more than 2 functions.
